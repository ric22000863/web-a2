This repo was created for my assignment 2 of my web application development module to showcase my ability to develop a mobile-first and responsive web solution that meets requirements. To open the project and view the code, you should install Visual Studio or VS Code and clone the repository. View the website, simply open the index.html file to land into the homepage. This website allows users to read about the story of the Skewer House business, view their menus,  provides the front end ONLY to book a table, order a custom cheesecake or takeway and allows the user to contact the business.
